# IPv Extractor
Parses through an input.csv to generate all instances an ipv4/6 address was mentioned. Should work on any csv file. Does NOT produce headers, will be implemented in a later version... Probably.

## Notes
Created using Google IDX, only ipv_extractor.py is needed to run.
Requires from pip:
`csv
ipaddress`

## Flask
A Flask starter template as per the docs: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application
